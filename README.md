# Quadrupeds
This is the repository that I put all the arduino codes of my quadruped robots. 
MK 3 is an insect-like robot. 
MK 4 is a mammal-like robot. 
MK 5 is a mammal-like robot. 
The arduino code files for MK 3, MK 4, MK 5 are named quadruped_MK_3.ino, quadruped_MK_4.ino, and quadruped_MK_5.ino, respectively. 
The VPython code files for MK 2 and MK 3 are in txt format, and are named quadruped_mk2_vpythonscript(mammal_like).txt, quadruped_mk3_vpythonscript(insect-like).txt, respectively.
